#Question 2
What is the major benefit of reconciliation? What did reconciliation do?
A major benefit is checking for errors and duplications.
Reconciliation links data to a source. checks for spelling mistakes and duplications lets you change
all of the names to match the source in one click, so that all the that is similiar is entered the same.
