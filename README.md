<h3 align="center">Author - Justin Jordan</h3>

A repository for Data 1201 materials.

We have been working on terminal commands, Markdown commands, exploring what it means to be a Data Scientist and the thought processes behind the concept. This is a repository that will hold all of the future work from Data 1201 - Explorations in Data Science!
